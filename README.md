### What I learned
I have learned a lot of concepts while building this project like now I am confident with:
- Node.js Architecture
- Node.js installation
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- JSON File
- Node.js Basics
- File System
- Events
- HTTP Module
- Frameworks
- Databases
- Node.js with socket.io 
- Node app deployment
- Websocket Protocol: The WebSocket protocol
                      supports real-time bi-direction communication, which makes it a great fit for this chat
                      application.
